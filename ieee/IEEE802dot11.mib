-- **********************************************************************

-- * The primary interface to the radio measurements and Wireless 
-- * Network Management functions is meant to be real-time information 
-- * obtained through the request/response mechanisms of RM and WNM. 
-- * A secondary interface to the measurements and management functions
-- * is through retention of information in this MIB. Non-SNMP requests 
-- * for information are obtained via object IDs (OIDs) through the NDIS 
-- * or wireless interfaces in the operating systems. SNMP requests for
-- * information are obtained via SNMP SETs and GETs (see [B26]).

-- *  dot11RMRequest and dot11RMReport Usage
-- *
-- * The dot11RMRequest and dot11RMReport portions of the RM MIB
-- * provide access to the Radio Measurement service. By performing
-- * SET operations on the various dot11RMRequest MIB objects,
-- * radio measurements may be initiated directly on the local STA or
-- * on any peer station within the same BSS. Subsequently, by
-- * performing GET operations on the various dot11RMReport MIB
-- * objects the results of the requested measurements may be
-- * retrieved.
-- *
-- * In the diagram below, a radio measurement could be initiated
-- * for STA x by performing a MIB.set operation on the RM MIB of
-- * STA x and specifying the MAC address of STA x in
-- * dot11RMRqstTargetAdd. Additionally, it is possible to have STA x
-- * request a measurement from STA y by performing a MIB.set operation
-- * on the SME MIB of STA x and specifying the MAC address of STA y in
-- * dot11RMRqstTargetAdd. In both cases the result of the measurements
-- * can be retrieved by performing a MIB.get operation on the RM MIB
-- * of STA x upon completion of the measurement.

-- * Each STA maintains a single dot11RMRequestTable in the SME MIB
-- * used to initiate RM Measurement Requests. Each dot11RMRequestEntry
-- * in the table represents an individual Measurement Request that
-- * makes up a complete Measurement Request frame.
-- * Multiple Measurement Requests may be concatenated into a single
-- * Measurement Request frame by setting the same
-- * dot11RMRqstToken value into multiple dot11RMRequestEntrys.
-- *
-- * Each row, dot11RMRequestEntry, of the dot11RMRequestTable
-- * provides read-create access for the initiation of a measurement
-- * request. The dot11RMRequestNextIndex object can be used to
-- * determine which is the next available row. Each row corresponding to
-- * one measurement in the sequence is created with a dot11RMRqstRowStatus
-- * equal to notInService. Once the dot11RMRequestEntry(s) have been
-- * created for a desired measurement sequence the corresponding
-- * dot11RMRqstRowStatus(s) objects are set to active to indicate that
-- * the SME can trigger the appropriate MLME primitives. Upon processing
-- * the request, the SME returns the corresponding dot11RMRqstRowStatus(s)
-- * object to notInService and are now available for additional
-- * measurement requests.
-- *
-- * After a radio measurement is complete the RM populates the RMReport
-- * objects with the results of the measurement. Each STA maintains a set
-- * of RMReport tables, one corresponding to each measurement type. The
-- * results of the entire measurement sequence are spread across the tables
-- * based on the type of measurements requested. Each xxxReportEntry
-- * within a xxxReportTable contains a xxxRprtRqstToken that corresponds
-- * to the original dot11RMRqstToken in the measurement request. So the
-- * results of the measurement can be collected by searching the appropriate
-- * xxxReportTables and retrieve any reports with the matching request
-- * token.
-- *
-- * Similar structures and mechanisms are used for WNM 
-- * Request and Reports. The WNM MIB definitions follow the RM MIB definitions
-- * in this Annex.

	DESCRIPTION 
		"This group contains the current list of requests for RM reports to be issued and have been issued until removed. A network manager adds an RM request by creating a row with createAndWait row status and then filling in the request parameters/attributes. The request becomes active to be issued when the row status is set to Active. The columnar objects or attributes other than the rowStatus are not written if the rowStatus is Active. The request rows can be deleted, if commanded by a network manager via changing the value of dot11RMRqstRowStatus to Destroy. This may leave orphaned rows if a manager crashes and forgets which rows are being used by it. One recommended way to manage orphaned or finished rows is to delete rows if their dot11RMRqstRowStatus remains other than Active for longer than a period (recommend at least 5 minutes, IETF RFC 2579). Or another recommended way is to delete older rows as needed based on their dot11RMRqstTimeStamp values. This can be done by the agent as well as the manager. "

The request rows can be deleted, if commanded by a network manager via changing the value of dot11WNMRqstRowStatus to Destroy.

One recommended way to manage orphaned or finished rows is to delete rows if their dot11WNMRqstRowStatus remains other than Active for longer than a period (recommend at least 5 minutes, IETF RFC 2579).
